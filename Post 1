<p>Participants in a clinical trial lost over 50 pounds on average when they were treated with the highest dose of a new hunger suppressant,&nbsp;<a href="https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lillys-tirzepatide-delivered-225-weight-loss-adults-obesity-or" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according</a>&nbsp;to the drugmaker Eli Lilly.</p>

<p>While the drug called tirzepatide has made headlines, it is important to note that it is still experimental and has not been approved or authorized by the Food and Drug Administration. Additionally, the initial research has been made public by the drug maker Eli Lilly and has not yet been published in a peer-reviewed medical journal.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While it is still early, some medical experts say that new treatments are needed to treat obesity.</p>

<p>“Obesity is a chronic disease that often does not receive the same standard of care as other conditions, despite its impact on physical, psychological and metabolic health, which can include increased risk of hypertension, heart disease, cancer and decreased survival,” study investigator Louis J. Aronne, MD, of Weill Cornell Medicine in New York City, said in a&nbsp;<a href="https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lillys-tirzepatide-delivered-225-weight-loss-adults-obesity-or" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">statement</a>.</p>

<h2><a>What the study found</a></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The 72-week, phase III&nbsp;<a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04184622?term=surmount-1&amp;draw=2&amp;rank=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SURMOUNT-1 clinical trial&nbsp;</a>found that people taking 15 mg of a once-weekly injectable drug called tirzepatide lost 22.5 percent of their body weight – for an average weight loss among participants of 52 pounds.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>According to Eli Lilly, the trial was a double-blind, placebo study run at multiple centers with 2,539 participants. The researchers compared the efficacy and safety of tirzepatide in varying doses to a placebo.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The drug combines synthetic mimics of two hormones called&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6812410/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GLP-1Trusted Source</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/gastric-inhibitory-polypeptide" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GIP</a>&nbsp;that our bodies naturally release after a meal to make us feel full.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Trial participants, who weighed 230 pounds on average at trial start, self-injected tirzepatide once per week at varying doses or a placebo.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The people participating in the study had obesity and had at least one comorbidity including high blood pressure, obstructive sleep apnea, or cardiovascular disease. No one had type 2 diabetes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity were followed by all participants during the 72-week study period.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Findings indicate that the highest dose was most effective, resulting in an average weight loss of more than 50 pounds, an average weight reduction of nearly 23 percent.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, participants injecting the placebo only lost about five pounds on average, even though they also cut calories and increased exercise.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Commonly reported adverse events included nausea, constipation, and diarrhea. They were generally mild to moderate in severity, and typically occurred when the dose was increased.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The Tirzepatide data looks impressive and highlights a new class of highly effective medications to treat obesity,” said Dr.&nbsp;<a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/staff/23060-w-scott-butsch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">W. Scott Butsch</a>, MD, Director of Obesity Medicine in the Bariatric and Metabolic Institute at Cleveland Clinic.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Butsch added that it’s the first drug to produce an average of 20 percent weight loss.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Which is twice as much as the current obesity medications outside this class,” he said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“To have a highly effective medical treatment is an important step in treating the disease of obesity and helping our patients who commonly think that if a lifestyle change doesn’t work then bariatric surgery is the only option,” continued Butsch.</p>
